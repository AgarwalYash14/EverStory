### üöÄ Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with:
- **React 19** with **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vite** for lightning-fast builds and development
- **Redux** for global state management
- **React Query** for efficient server state management and caching
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive styling with dark mode support
- **Feature-based folder structure** for scalable maintenance

### üîß Backend Architecture

EverStory uses FastAPI microservices (Auth, Image, Friendship, WebSocket) with dedicated PostgreSQL databases for each service. Kong API Gateway handles routing and authentication between services. Everything is containerized with Docker for consistent deployment and isolated scaling.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Choice

EverStory uses PostgreSQL for each microservice with dedicated isolated databases. PostgreSQL was selected for its ACID compliance, robust JSON support essential for social content, and strong performance with complex relational data like friendship networks. This approach enables independent scaling while maintaining data consistency across services.

## ‚ú® Features

### Authentication & User Management
- **JWT-based authentication** with secure cookie handling for stateless authentication
- **User registration** with email, username and password validation
- **Protected routes** with role-based access control using React Router guards
- **Profile management** with image uploads and personal information updates

### Posts & Content
- **Post Management**: Create, view, edit, and delete posts with real-time updates
- **Advanced Image Processing**: 
  - Client-side compression before upload to reduce bandwidth
  - Server-side Cloudinary integration for automated image optimization
  - Format conversion for optimal browser support (WebP, AVIF where supported)
  - Progressive loading for improved perceived performance
- **Privacy Control**: Toggle between private (friends-only) and public post visibility
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Virtualized lists optimized for performance with React's Intersection Observer
- **Responsive Images**: Multiple resolution variants served based on device screen size and network conditions
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration notifies users of new posts, comments, and likes instantaneously

### Social Features
- **Friendship System**: Complete friend request workflow (send, accept, reject) with proper state management
- **Friend List Management**: View, search, and filter friends with pagination
- **Privacy-Aware Content**: Content visibility restrictions based on relationship status
- **Interactive Engagement**: Like and comment on posts with optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback

### Advanced UI/UX Features
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout adapting to all screen sizes from mobile to desktop
- **Dark Mode**: Comprehensive theme support with persistent user preferences stored locally
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Immediate interface updates before server confirmation for perceived performance
- **Debounced Search**: Implementation of 300ms search input debouncing to prevent excessive API calls while typing
  ```typescript
  // Debounced search implementation
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  const [debouncedTerm, setDebouncedTerm] = useState('');
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => setDebouncedTerm(searchTerm), 300);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [searchTerm]);
  
  // The debouncedTerm is used for API calls after typing stops
  ```
- **Progressive Image Loading**: Blur-up technique for image loading with low-resolution placeholders
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation feedback with helpful error messages
- **Skeleton Loading States**: Custom skeleton components during content loading for improved UX

## üèÜ Completed Bonus Features

EverStory fully implements the bonus requirements with complete Dockerization of all services (Auth, Image, Friendship, WebSocket) using Docker Compose. Kong API Gateway manages service routing and authentication with automated setup scripts. Separate PostgreSQL databases are integrated for each microservice with proper isolation and connection management.

## üñºÔ∏è Image Upload Process

When a user uploads an image to EverStory, our optimized workflow ensures high quality with minimal storage and bandwidth requirements:

1. **Client-side Validation**
   - File type checking (JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
   - Basic client-side size validation
   - Preview generation for immediate feedback

2. **Upload to Image Service**
   - The image is securely uploaded to our image-service microservice
   - Temporary server storage while processing

3. **Image Optimization and Processing**
   - **Cloudinary Integration**: Images are processed through our Cloudinary integration with:
     - Automatic quality optimization (`quality: "auto"`)
     - Format conversion to most efficient format based on browser support (`fetch_format: "auto"`)
     - Progressive loading for better user experience
     - Multiple resolution variants for responsive design:
       - Thumbnail: 200√ó200px crop
       - Medium: 600px width (scaled)
       - Large: 1200px width (limited, quality-optimized)
   - **Responsive Breakpoints**: System generates multiple sizes (200px to 1000px) for different devices
   - **Compression**: Smart compression without visible quality loss

4. **Fallback Processing**
   - Local optimization if Cloudinary is unavailable:
     - Resize to maximum width of 1920px
     - Convert to RGB color space
     - Apply 85% quality JPEG compression
     - Generate progressive JPEGs for better loading experience

5. **Storage and Reference**
   - Image URL and metadata stored in database
   - Original upload safely deleted after processing
   - Image public ID tracked for future management

6. **Delivery to Users**
   - Images served from CDN for global high-speed access
   - Appropriate image size automatically selected based on user's device
   - Lazy loading implementation for performance optimization

## ü§ù Friendship System

EverStory implements a straightforward friendship system using a relational database model. The platform tracks connections between users with explicit states (pending, accepted, rejected) and provides privacy controls based on friendship status. The current implementation focuses on direct user-to-user connections without complex scoring algorithms.

## üìù Feedback

The microservices architecture challenge provided excellent hands-on experience with real-world patterns. The emphasis on proper service isolation and API gateway implementation helped solidify advanced concepts. Would appreciate more guidance on WebSocket integration with microservices in future iterations.
